An analysis of data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository of a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The dataset includes survey results asking individuals if they would accept a coupon, along with information about the person and the driving scenario in which they are offerred the coupon.

The different types of coupons offerred were: Bar, Carryout and Take Away, Coffee House, Restaurant($20-$50), and Restaurant(less than $20).
Of these coupon categories, 'Carryout and Take Away' and 'Retaurant(less than $20)' were the most likely categories for a person to accept the coupon.
The least likely category to be accepted is the 'Bar' category.

Within each of these categories, further analysis can be done to identify trends.
For instance, within the 'Bar' category of coupons, a person is almost twice as likely to accept the coupon if they already go to a bar more than 3 times a month. As such, people who go to a bar more than 3 times a month should be a primary target demographic for these coupons.
In contrast, people with lower incomes and who frequent cheaper restaurants are almost 4 times less likely to accept a coupon. This tells us that they may have less disposable income to spend at a bar, and therefore are less likely to even accept a coupon for one.

We can also look at the carryout coupon category.
Coupons are less likely to be accepted in the morning hours, regardless of income, or when the coupon expires. In the afternoon and evening hours, however, people with lower incomes are more likely to accept the coupon. More people are also likely to accept a coupon that expires in 1d rather than 2h
I hypothesize that this is due to the fact that carryout/take away restaurants tend to be "spur of the moment" decisions, which are more likely to be accepted in the evenings when people have more free time. In the morning and during lunch, people are more likely to have pre-planned meals.
